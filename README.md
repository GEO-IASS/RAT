#### RAT (Radar Tools)

RAT (Radar Tools) is a powerful open-source software tool for processing SAR 
(Synthetic Aperture Radar) remote sensing data programmed in IDL. It has been developed for several years at
the Berlin University of Technology and is now _discontinued_! This repository contains
the very last version of RAT, which received a bunch of bugfixes to make it work with
current IDL versions. For further information, please visit the 
[RAT webpage](http://rat.radartools.org).

Please note that there is an active follow-up project called [PyRAT](https://github.com/birgander2/PyRAT) 
hosted on Github. Please have a look there!
